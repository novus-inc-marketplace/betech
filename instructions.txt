"Edit and improvise the static html in this betech directory to Create an effective, professional website design tailored for BETECH COMPUTERS, specializing in selling laptops,
phones, computers, and accessories with a preference for a blue color palette focusing on professional yet
eye-catching visuals. The website should include:

1. **Logo & Brand Identity:** A prominent, large blue logo prominently featured at the top of the page.
2. **Navigation Bar:** A simple, easily accessible navigation bar with links to Home, About, and Contact sections.
3. **Product Categories:**
   - Large images of laptops in dark blue (professional look) for desktops/PCs.
   - Product images in muted blue for phones and accessories (lighter tones).
   - Product categories labeled "Laptops," "Phones & Accessories," and "Computers" with corresponding images.
4. **Contact Section:**
   - Detailed contact information (name, address, phone number) displayed prominently at the bottom of the Home
tab.
   - An easily accessible contact form for customers to input their needs or purchase details.
5. **Social Media Links:** A list of social media profiles (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn) linked to customer service
representatives.
6. **Image Grids:** Large, professional-looking images from different tech products and accessories in bold blue
text to highlight focus areas.


**Additional Considerations:**
- Ensure that text is legible in low-light conditions (bottom margin).
- Use soft colors like indigo or teal for highlights and important sections.
- Include social media icons if possible for better visual appeal.
- The design should be responsive to mobile devices, with images being appropriately sized and centered.
